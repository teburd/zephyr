config RTIO_EXECUTOR_SIMPLE
	bool "A simple executor for RTIO"
	default y
	help
	  An simple RTIO executor that will execute a queue of requested I/O
	  operations as if they are a single chain of submission queue entries. This
	  does not support concurrent chains.

config RTIO_SUBMIT_SEM
	bool "Use a semaphore when waiting for completions in rtio_submit"
	help
	  When calling rtio_submit a semaphore is available to sleep the calling
	  thread for each completion queue event until the wait count is met. This
	  adds a small RAM overhead for a single semaphore. By default wait_for will
	  use polling on the completion queue with a k_yield() in between iterations.

config RTIO_CONSUME_SEM
	bool "Use a semaphore when waiting for completions in rtio_cqe_consume_block"
	help
	  When calling rtio_cqe_consume_block a semaphore is available to sleep the
	  calling thread for each completion queue event until the wait count is met.
	  This adds a small RAM overhead for a single semaphore. By default the call
	  will use polling on the completion queue with a k_yield() in between
	  iterations.
